# Aircraft Damage Detection

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying aircraft damage from images using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.
The goal is to demonstrate how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be applied to real-world aviation safety and inspection problems.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Manual aircraft damage inspection is time-consuming and error-prone.
This project explores an automated image-based damage detection system that can assist in identifying damage patterns using deep learning models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone data repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syrilsibi/-Aircraft-Damage-Detection.git
   cd -Aircraft-Damage-Detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏃 Usage

Run the main analysis script:
```bash
python Final_Project_Classification_and_Captioning-v1.py
```
*Note: The script automatically downloads and extracts the dataset if not present.*

## 🧪 Methodology

- Image preprocessing and normalization
- CNN-based feature extraction
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation using classification metrics
- Prediction on unseen aircraft images

## 📊 Model Capabilities
